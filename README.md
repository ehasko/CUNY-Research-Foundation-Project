# CUNY-Research-Foundation-Project

>I was assigned this project when I started working as a CUNY Researcher and Computer Lab Assistant for LaGuardia Community College. I designed a program that compares the school's registrar database against the active directory database to determine whether a student record should be added or removed from the active directory.
